# D01: Find drug concept by concept ID

## Description
This is the lookup for obtaining drug concept details associated with a concept identifier. This query is intended as a tool for quick reference for the name, class, level and source vocabulary details associated with a concept identifier.
This query is equivalent to  [G01](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/general-queries/g1), but if the concept is not in the drug domain the query still returns the concept details with the Is_Drug_Concept_Flag field set to 'No'.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
        C.concept_id Drug_concept_id,
        C.concept_name Drug_concept_name,
        C.concept_code Drug_concept_code,
        C.concept_class_id Drug_concept_class,
        C.standard_concept Drug_concept_level,
        C.vocabulary_id Drug_concept_vocab_id,
        V.vocabulary_name Drug_concept_vocab_code,
        /*( CASE C.vocabulary_id
                WHEN 'RxNorm' THEN
                        CASE lower(C.concept_class_id)
                        WHEN 'clinical drug' THEN 'Yes'
                        WHEN 'branded drug' THEN 'Yes'
                        WHEN 'ingredient' THEN 'Yes'
                        WHEN 'branded pack' THEN 'Yes'
                        WHEN 'clinical pack' THEN 'Yes'
                        ELSE 'No' END
                ELSE 'No' END) Is_Drug_Concept_flag */
        (CASE C.domain_id WHEN 'Drug' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END) Is_Drug_Concept_flag
FROM
        @vocab.concept C,
        @vocab.vocabulary V
WHERE
        C.vocabulary_id = V.vocabulary_id
        AND getdate() >= C.valid_start_date
        AND getdate() <= C.valid_end_date
        AND C.concept_id = 1545999;
```
