Indications have to be provided as FDB (vocabulary_id=19) or NDF-RT indications (vocabulary_id=7).

## Query
```sql
SELECT
      c.concept_id     as drug_concept_id,
      c.concept_name   as drug_concept_name,
      c.concept_class_id  as drug_concept_class_id
FROM @vocab.concept c
INNER JOIN (
  SELECT drug.cid FROM (
    SELECT a.descendant_concept_id cid, count(*) cnt FROM concept_ancestor a
    INNER JOIN (
      SELECT c.concept_id FROM concept c, concept_ancestor a
      WHERE a.ancestor_concept_id = 1000560
      AND a.descendant_concept_id = c.concept_id AND c.vocabulary_id = 'RxNorm'
    ) cd ON cd.concept_id = a.descendant_concept_id
    INNER JOIN @vocab.concept c ON c.concept_id=a.ancestor_concept_id
        WHERE c.concept_class_id = 'Ingredient'
    GROUP BY a.descendant_concept_id
  ) drug WHERE drug.cnt = 1  -- contains only 1 ingredient
) onesie ON onesie.cid = c.concept_id
WHERE (getdate() >= valid_start_date) AND (getdate() <= valid_end_date)
```
